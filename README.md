Introduction

This project focuses on building a predictive model for healthcare insurance charges. By analyzing the provided dataset, the goal is to build various regression models, evaluate their performance, and choose the best one. We will then validate the final model on a validation dataset.
Dataset

The dataset contains information on healthcare insurance charges for individuals, including:

    Age
    Sex
    Region
    Smoker Status
    Number of Children
    Body Mass Index (BMI)
    Insurance Charges (Target Variable)

Steps Followed
1. Data Cleaning

Before analyzing and modeling the dataset, the following cleaning steps are performed:

    Handle Missing Data: We check for any missing data and handle it appropriately (e.g., removing rows, filling with mean/median).
    Correct Data Types: Ensure categorical columns are correctly typed (e.g., sex, region).
    Save Cleaned Dataset: The cleaned dataset is saved as cleaned_healthcare_insurance.csv.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform EDA to understand the dataset better:

    Visualize Distribution: Analyze distributions of continuous variables like age, BMI, and charges.
    Correlation Analysis: Look for correlations between features and the target variable.
    Outlier Detection: Identify outliers using boxplots or other visualizations.
3. Splitting Data into Train and Test Sets

The cleaned data is split into training and test sets to evaluate the model performance:
4. Training Regression Models

Train multiple regression models, such as:

    Linear Regression
    Ridge Regression
    Lasso Regression
    ElasticNet Regression
    SVR
    Polynomial Regression

Evaluate each model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., R², Mean Squared Error).
5. Model Evaluation and Selection

After training the models, evaluate their performance:

    Compare Models: Use metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE to compare the models.
    Select Best Model: Based on performance on the test data, choose the model with the best predictive ability.
6. Validation with the Validation Dataset

Once the best model is selected, validate it using the validation dataset:

    Load Validation Data: Use the validation dataset to check model robustness.
    Evaluate Performance: Compare the results with test data performance.
Conclusion

In this project, multiple regression models were used to predict healthcare insurance charges. After cleaning the dataset and performing EDA, the best regression model was chosen based on its performance. The final model was validated using a separate validation dataset, confirming its effectiveness.
